Accessible dropdown is a lightweight script that makes your navigation dropdown menu accessible. It adds all required ARIA attributes for screen readers and implements keyboard accessibility.
Does not require jQuery or any other javascript library.

Inspired by [Adobe Accessible Mega Menu](https://adobe-accessibility.github.io/Accessible-Mega-Menu/).
